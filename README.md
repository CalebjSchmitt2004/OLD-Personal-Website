# Personal-Website

        This Webiste is used to broadcast my services and projects for furture employment and project opertunites. 
        This site is hosted using on of my virtualized clusters and allows me complete controll over the sites look, 
        function, uptime and more. While it may not be the best looking site ever, as I am not a web developer, it
        should showcase the services I am well versed with like networking and systems infulstructure.
